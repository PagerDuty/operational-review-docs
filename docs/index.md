Operational reviews are the practice of regularly gathering metrics with your teams, in a cohesive way across your organization, to drive positive business outcomes. When transforming digital practices, many organizations struggle to quantify and measure their progress in meaningful ways. By gathering and learning from metrics on a regular cadence at every organizational level—practitioner, management, and executive—teams can make better data-driven decisions around improving work in ways that align daily practices with long-term business results. This guide shows you how to build that practice at each organizational level.

## Who Is This For?
This guide is for digital business leaders who want to create a cohesive strategy around capturing metrics that both quantify and drive organizational change. If you’re driving the adoption of DevOps principles, guiding a digital transformation, or driving greater operational maturity—as a team manager, department/division leader, or an executive—then these docs are for you.

Anyone who is part of a technical team that manages real-time operations (for example, a digital service that may experience [unplanned incidents](https://response.pagerduty.com)) will also find this documentation useful, including software [engineers who go on call](https://ownership.pagerduty.com), technical program managers, [agile coaches](https://retrospectives.pagerduty.com), or anyone else whose job involves leading change and implementing effective processes. Ultimately, we encourage you to share this documentation with all of your teams rather than siloing this information or letting it live solely in the realm of management. Driving organizational change requires transparency, autonomy, accountability, and—above all—knowledge-sharing.
